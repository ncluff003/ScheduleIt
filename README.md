    <h2 style='font-size: 20px; text-indent: 1rem;'>What Is ScheduleIt And Why Use It?</h2>
    <p style='font-size: 16px; text-indent: 1.5rem;'> As stated earlier, ScheduleIt is aimed to help freelancers schedule appointments with potential clients.  Also, the reason to use ScheduleIt is simple.  First, you can only get clients if they know you ARE available, and they know WHEN you are available.  From there, they will need a way to contact you about potential work.  Then, if they try to contact you, you need a way to know they are trying to do so.  Then, likely most important for freelancers, all of this functionality must come cheaper as freelancers usually do not start out with lots of money to use other software that require subscriptions.  That is where ScheduleIt comes into play.</p>
    <p>
        The ultimate goal in creating ScheduleIt was to help facilitate those initial meetings with potential clients for freelancers.  That way, successful freelancer to client relationships could begin and do so without much cost.  In this case... FREE!

    <h3 style='font-size: 20px; text-indent: 1rem;'>The Future Of ScheduleIt</h3>
    <p style='font-size: 16px; text-indent: 1.5rem;'>The hope for ScheduleIt is simple.  I want it to evolve to not only become better and more intuitive for users, but also expand to be able to include far more databases and options for communication with potential clients.  It will take time, but it is the goal.</p>
